# Linear algebra

## Repository description

This repository contains code related to the Linear Algebra course by Mike X. Cohen on Udemy:

[Master linear algebra: theory and implementation in code](https://www.udemy.com/course/linear-algebra-theory-and-implementation)

The majority of the "base" code is adapted from material developed by the course instructor. I have made minor modifications to experiment with it. The "code challenges" files contain more of my own contributions, where I added creative input beyond the provided material.
